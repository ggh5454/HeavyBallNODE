# Heavy Ball Neural Ordinary Differential Equations

This repository is based on the official implementation of **Heavy Ball Neural Ordinary Differential Equations** by [Hedi Xia](https://github.com/hedixia/HeavyBallNODE). The original repository can be found [here](https://github.com/hedixia/HeavyBallNODE).
The code is based on Pytorch and torchdiffeq, and all default numerical solvers used in the experiments are dopri5.

## Usage

Download walker2d data by 

`python data_download.py`

Data format shape: 
[timestamps, batch, channels (derivatives), feature dimension]

Usage:

First create a NODE type module by 

`cell = NODE(...)`

Or a HBNODE by 

`cell = HBNODE(...)`

And turn it into a time series model by 

`model = NODEintegrate(cell)`

It can also be used as a residual network analogy by

`model = NODElayer(cell)`

For NODE-RNN type hybrids, use 

`model = ODE_RNN(ode, cell, nhid, ic)`

here `nhid` is the hidden shape (same shape as ode / cell input and output). `ic` is the initial conditions.
